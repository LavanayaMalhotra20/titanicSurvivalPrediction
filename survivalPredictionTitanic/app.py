  ### Titanic Survival Prediction Model üö¢‚öì

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting and selecting key features to improve model accuracy.
- Model Training: Using [model name(s), e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.] to predict survival outcomes.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Including insights and visual representations of data trends and model predictions.
### Features:
- Jupyter Notebook with detailed code and explanations.
- Results and insights from the analysis.
- Ready-to-use scripts for replication or further exploration.
- This project is perfect for beginners exploring machine learning or those interested in classic datasets. üßë‚Äçüíªüìä

    ### Titanic Dataset Overview

    The Titanic dataset contains 891 entries with 12 columns, including both numerical and categorical data. Below is an overview:

    - **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
    - **Survived**: Indicates survival (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).
    - **Pclass**: Passenger's class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
    - **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
    - **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male/female).
    - **Age**: Age in years (missing values are NaN).
    - **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
    - **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard.
    - **Ticket**: Ticket number.
    - **Fare**: Passenger fare.
    - **Cabin**: Cabin number (most values are missing).
    - **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

    ### Data Insights

    - The dataset has missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
    - The majority of passengers are male (577 out of 891).
    - The dataset is imbalanced, with approximately 38.4% survival rate.

    ### Preprocessing Steps

    - Handle Missing Values: Impute missing `Age`, `Embarked`, and potentially drop or impute `Cabin`.
    - Feature Encoding: Convert `Sex` and `Embarked` into numerical values for model compatibility.
    - Feature Selection: Use columns like `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, and `Embarked` for prediction.

    This dataset is ideal for binary classification tasks and serves as a classic example of predictive modeling.
