# Titanic Survival Prediction Model 🚢⚓
## This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The project demonstrates end-to-end implementation, including:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting and selecting key features to improve model accuracy.
- Model Training: Using [model name(s), e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.] to predict survival outcomes.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Including insights and visual representations of data trends and model predictions.
## Features:
- Jupyter Notebook with detailed code and explanations.
- Results and insights from the analysis.
- Ready-to-use scripts for replication or further exploration.
## This project is perfect for beginners exploring machine learning or those interested in classic datasets. 🧑‍💻📊
